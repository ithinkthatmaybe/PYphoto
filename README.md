#PYphoto - Helps with photo sorting 
------------



## HDR, timelapse & Panorama sort

The main reason I started this project. The first stage of proccessing photos allways seems to be removing hundreds of bracketed or continuous shooting photos. This simply looks at time differences and Exposure Bias in EXIF data to determine if photos are HDR, or were taken in continous mode, these can then be moved to a seperate folder
